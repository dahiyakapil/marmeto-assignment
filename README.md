# marmeto-assignment

I created a project aimed at fetching and displaying product details for user-selected categories from an external API on a web page. By clicking on a category tab, the corresponding products are showcased as cards. The information fetched from the API is accurately presented within the designated layout. Users can switch categories by deselecting their current choice and selecting another.
